# Network Topologies with Mininet

This project demonstrates how to create and test different network topologies using **Mininet**. It includes two Python scripts that build **Linear** and **Tree** topologies, allowing hands-on experience with network simulation, configuration, and connectivity testing.

## Topologies Implemented

### 1. Linear Topology

A simple chain of switches and hosts, connected in a straight line.

```
h1 --- s1 --- s2 --- h3
       |
       h2
```

**File:** `linear_topology.py`
**Features:**

* 3 Hosts and 2 Switches
* Custom link parameters (bandwidth, delay, loss)
* Connectivity tested with `pingAll()`

### 2. Tree Topology

A hierarchical structure of switches and hosts, simulating a multi-level network.

```
          s1
         /  \
       s2    s3
      / \    / \
    h1  h2  h3  h4
```

**File:** `tree_topology.py`
**Features:**

* 3 Levels of switches (depth = 3, fanout = 2)
* Automatic host creation at the lowest level
* Flexible topology generation for research and testing

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Install Mininet

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y mininet
```

### 2. Verify Python Installation

```bash
python3 --version
```

## Usage

### Run the Linear Topology

```bash
sudo python3 linear_topology.py
```

### Run the Tree Topology

```bash
sudo python3 tree_topology.py
```

### Inside the Mininet CLI

Once the CLI opens, you can test and explore the network:

```bash
mininet> pingall        # Test connectivity between all hosts
mininet> nodes          # List all nodes
mininet> net            # Display network connections
mininet> h1 ifconfig    # View host interface details
```

## Learning Objectives

Through this lab, you will learn to:

* Create custom topologies using Mininet’s Python API
* Understand hierarchical (Tree) and sequential (Linear) network designs
* Test and debug network connectivity using Mininet CLI commands
* Configure link properties such as bandwidth, delay, and packet loss

## Cleanup

To exit the CLI and clean up the network:

```bash
mininet> exit
```

Mininet will automatically remove all virtual network elements.

Would you like me to include a short **“Repository Structure”** section (e.g., listing `linear_topology.py`, `tree_topology.py`, and a `/screenshots/` folder) to make it more GitHub-friendly?
